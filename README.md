# UBI-Model: see link https://github.com/Aleida24/UBI-Model
This is a simple model of a potential UBI system within the context of the existing U.S. welfare system created for a final project in Computational Social Science (a graduate course in Python at New York University). 

See the main two code chunks (labeled part 1 and part 2) for more background and context. 

The needed data files are included in this repository. All other files needed for part 2 are generated by code within part 1. 

Thoughts/comments welcome!
